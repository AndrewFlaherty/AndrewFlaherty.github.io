        <p><h3>Bailey</h3></p>
        <p>My dog Bailey is a cockapoo and she was our first dog. She is currently 8 years old, but she still has plenty of energy.</p>
        <p><h3>Baxter</h3></p>
        <p>Baxter is a rescue dog that we got 2 years ago and we really aren't too sure what kind of dog he is or how old he is but we assume he is about 3.</p>
        <p> Here is a picture of them while they were out playing.</p>
