        <p><h3>Mountain Biking</h3></p>
        <p>One of my more recent hobbies is mountain biking, which I started doing about 3 years ago.</p>
        <p>I first started mountain biking, with my friend Ethan, on the trails behind my house. After about a year, my dad started mountain biking again so he and I go out to a lot of different trails during the summer.</p>
        <p><h3>Skiing</h3></p>
        <p>Another one of my hobbies is skiing, which I have been doing since I was about 7.</p>
        <p>I first started skiing at a mountain called Sugarloaf which is located in Maine. I really enjoy skiing, but I also want to try out snowboarding because I have been told it is really fun.</p>
